# ConfigFiles
These are just my personal configuration files for vim and OSX terminal.

### Getting started

#### .vimrc file

This file modifies your vim configuration to include many useful visuals such as highlighted identifiers and line numbers.

To install this, just navigate to your root directory and type in ```vim .vimrc```. Now you should be able to copy and paste the contents of this repo's into your local configuration.

#### .bash_profile

This file modifies the OSX terminal settings, mainly for color.

To install this, just navigate to your root directory (same as above) and type in ```vim .bash_profile```. Now you should be able to copy and paste the contents of this repo's into your local configuration.
